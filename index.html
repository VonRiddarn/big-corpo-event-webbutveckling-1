				<h2>Bigcorp LLC inc. is hosting the biggest event yet!</h2>
				<p>
					That's right, there will be an event, a great event. I have a friend, you see, the nicest
					friend, the best friend. He said to me, you know what he said - he said that he went to
					this huge event, this massive event, and that it was perfect. He said to me, in no
					uncertain terms "This was the best event of my life!" - now, is that not an event you'd
					want to visit?

				<h2>What does it cost?</h2>
				<p>
					To put a price on an event such as this would almost feel unjust. It would be too
					expensive, because the event is so good. It's perfect, a billion dollars would only cover
					the rights to fantasize about the event - but we have managed to break it down and give
					you an affordable experience. Just check out our
					<a href="./pages/pricing.html">pricing</a> page.
